User stories:
1 - As a user, I want to see an interactive banner carousel on the blog feed page, so that I can view a
rotation of the 3 latest posts.

2 - As a user, I want to click on a button for each carousel item, taking me to the blog post page to
read more.

3 - As a user, I want to click on the previous or next button in the carousel to animate and reveal
another post, to ensure I can see different posts easily.

4 - As a user, I want the carousel to return to the first post after reaching the end of the list, and vice
versa when clicking previous on the first post.

5 - As a user, I want to view a static list of the 12 latest posts in a responsive thumbnail grid on the
blog feed page, so I can easily select which post to read.

page to read more.
